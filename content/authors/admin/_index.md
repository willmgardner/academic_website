I'm a researcher on the [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://www.healthdata.org/gbd) at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.heatlthdata.org) and a second year medical student at [Columbia University](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu). I conduct research in the areas of global maternal and child health, respiratory epidemiology, health systems performance and evaluation, and health metrics.
