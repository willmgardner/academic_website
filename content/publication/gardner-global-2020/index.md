abstract: 'Objectives To estimate the total prevalence of anemia by severity and quantify
  the contribution attributable to 35 underlying causes for 204 countries and territories
  by age and sex from 1990 to 2019. Methods We conducted a systematic review for data
  on mean and standard deviation of hemoglobin (Hb) by age and sex. Using a 3-step
  spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression, we estimated mean and standard deviation
  Hb by location, age, and sex from 1990 to 2019. We then calculated the total distribution
  of hemoglobin for each location, year, age, and sex and quantified the prevalence
  of anemia by severity (mild, moderate, and severe). Finally, using a counterfactual
  analysis, we calculated the portion of total anemia prevalence attributable to 35
  causes using cause-specific Hb shifts, cause prevalence, and the overall Hb distribution
  for each location, year, age, and sex. Results All ages anemia prevalence was 22.8%
  (95% CI: 22.6–23.1) globally in 2019, a decrease from 27.0% (26.7–27.2) in 1990.
  While prevalence decreased over this time, total cases of anemia increased from
  1.42 (1.41–1.43) billion in 1990 to 1.74 (1.72–1.76) billion in 2019. Prevalence
  was highest among children under five years, with a combined prevalence of 39.7%
  (39.0–40.4) in 2019. Globally, 54.1% (53.8–54.4) of anemia cases were mild, 42.5%
  (42.2–42.7) were moderate, and 3.4% (3.3–3.5) were severe. Anemia was responsible
  for 58.6 (40.14–81.1) million years lived with disability in 2019. The regions with
  the highest burden were Western Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central Sub-Saharan
  Africa. The top three contributing causes globally were Dietary iron deficiency,
  Vitamin A deficiency, and Beta-thalassemia trait, respectively. Conclusions Despite
  reductions in anemia prevalence globally, the burden of anemia remains persistently
  high in many regions. An increased focus on interventions is needed to accelerate
  progress toward meeting Global Nutrition Target 2, a 50% reduction of anemia in
  women of reproductive age by 2025, and to alleviate the substantial health loss
  in children under five years of age. These estimates of total burden of anemia by
  severity and its underlying causes allow for more precise targeting of interventions
  to the highest-burden regions and the causes contributing the most to total prevalence.
