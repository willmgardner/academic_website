abstract: 'Rationale: COVID-19 acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome
  (ALI/ARDS) are associated with hypercoagulability and reduced fibrinolysis. Emerging
  evidence suggests that thrombo-inflammation may underly post-acute sequelae of SARS
  CoV-2 (PASC). Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a sensitive and comprehensive
  measure of dysregulated coagulation; potentially useful in characterizing subclinical
  dysregulated coagulation in COVID ALI/ARDS survivors. We hypothesized that COVID
  ALI/ARDS survivors with PASC phenotypes would have subclinical evidence of persistent
  hypercoagulability. 
  <br /> <br /> 
  Methods: We conducted a single-center New York City-based prospective
  cohort study of 93 adults who survived COVID-19 ALI/ ARDS hospitalization in 2020.
  Participants were not receiving treatment with dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation
  and denied genetic disorders of coagulation at 15-month follow-up when they underwent
  assessment of fresh whole-blood samples using ROTEM. We concurrently measured the
  severity and frequency of 43 symptoms via questionnaires. The primary ROTEM parameter
  exposures of interest were maximum clot firmness (MCF) in EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM
  assays. The primary outcome of interest was PASC positivity based on the NIH Recover
  definition of a PASC score â‰¥ 12. We tested cross-sectional associations of ROTEM
  measures with the predicted risk of PASC phenotypes using generalized additive models
  with covariable balanced propensity scores to adjust for demographics, comorbidities,
  and single antiplatelet medication use. In sensitivity analyses, we tested associations
  with severe symptom phenotypes, defined as patient-reported moderate or greater
  post-exertional malaise (PEM), fatigue, or brain fog. 
  <br /> <br /> 
  Results: COVID ALI/ARDS survivors
  had a mean (SD) age of 55 (11) and 40% were women. Fifty (54%) received invasive
  mechanical ventilation, 17 (18%) received non-rebreather mask or non-invasive mechanical
  ventilation, and 26 (28%) received only nasal cannula oxygen. In adjusted analyses,
  we found that greater clot strength (MCF) in the INTEM and FIBTEM assays were directly
  and linearly associated with a higher predicted risk of PASC positivity. We observed
  similar direct linear associations of greater clot strength with predicted risk
  of PEM and fatigue, but not brain fog (Figure 1). Similar significant relationships
  were not identified in EXTEM assays. 
  <br /> <br /> 
  Conclusion: At 15 months follow-up, PASC positivity,
  PEM, and fatigue, but not brain fog, are associated with a subclinical hypercoagulable
  profile that appears to be driven by fibrinogen dysregulation in COVID ALI/ARDS
  survivors. Further work is needed to externally validate these findings and to investigate
  mechanistic drivers of these associations that may elucidate novel diagnostic and
  treatment approaches for physical symptoms of long COVID.'
