abstract: Historically, the prevalence of child growth failure (CGF) has been tracked
  dichotomously as the proportion of children more than 2 SDs below the median of
  the World Health Organization growth standards. However, this conventional “thresholding”
  approach fails to recognize child growth as a spectrum and obscures trends in populations
  with the highest rates of CGF. Our analysis presents the first ever estimates of
  entire distributions of HAZ, WHZ, and WAZ for each of 204 countries and territories
  from 1990 to 2020 for children less than 5 years old by age group and sex. This
  approach reflects the continuous nature of CGF, allows us to more comprehensively
  assess shrinking or widening disparities over time, and reveals otherwise hidden
  trends that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations.
