abstract: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF)—giving infants only breast-milk for the first
  6 months of life—is a component of optimal breastfeeding practices effective in
  preventing child morbidity and mortality. EBF practices are known to vary by population
  and comparable subnational estimates of prevalence and progress across low- and
  middle-income countries (LMICs) are required for planning policy and interventions.
  Here we present a geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence estimates from 2000 to 2018
  across 94 LMICs mapped to policy-relevant administrative units (for example, districts),
  quantify subnational inequalities and their changes over time, and estimate probabilities
  of meeting the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) of
  ≥70% EBF prevalence by 2030. While six LMICs are projected to meet the WHO GNT of
  ≥70% EBF prevalence at a national scale, only three are predicted to meet the target
  in all their district-level units by 2030.
