abstract: 'Objectives: To estimate prevalence of breastfeeding (exclusive, predominant,
  partial, and none) and trends for infants under six months of age for 204 countries
  and territories from 1990 to 2019. 
  <br /> <br /> 
  Methods: We conducted a systematic review for
  data on breastfeeding status for children under six months of age. We used survey
  and food diary data to categorize breastfeeding status into exclusive, predominant,
  partial, and none. Using a 3-step spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression, we
  modeled the prevalence of each breastfeeding category in 204 countries and territories,
  1990 to 2019. 
  <br /> <br />
  Results: Global prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in infants less
  than six months of age was 43.5% (95% CI 42.7–44.3) in 2019, up from 34.0% (32.7–35.3)
  in 1990. Globally, non-exclusive breastfeeding was distributed 30.5% (29.8–31.1)
  predominant, 16.6% (16.2–17.0) partial, and 9.4% (8.9–10.0) no breastfeeding in
  2019. Each of these categories experienced a decline in prevalence since 1990, when
  non-exclusive breastfeeding was 37.0% (36.0–38.1) predominant, 18.7% (18.1–19.4)
  partial, and 10.2% (9.5–11.0%) no breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding was highest
  in Andean Latin America (59.7% [57.4–61.9]), Oceania (56.8% [53.2–60.0]), and South
  Asia (53.9% [53.2–60.0]). There was marked geographic variation in the distribution
  of non-exclusive breastfeeding types. Predominant breastfeeding was highest in Western
  Sub-Saharan Africa (51.5% [49.8–53.2]) and Central Asia (47.2% [45.3–49.0), partial
  breastfeeding was highest in Southern Latin America (31.1% [28.4–34.0]) and the
  Caribbean (29.3% [27.6–31.1]), and no breastfeeding was highest in High-income North
  America (36.7% [31.0–42.5]) and Australasia (32.4% [26.3–36.4]). 
   <br /> <br /> 
  Conclusions: Since
  1990, global prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding has increased nearly 10 percentage
  points. Nonetheless, many countries are not on track to meet the WHO Global Nutrition
  Target of at least 50% of infants under 6 months exclusively breastfeeding. These
  cross-nationally comparable estimates of current levels and trends in breastfeeding
  status provide useful data for targeting interventions to improve breastfeeding
  practices and to help alleviate the associated global burden of infant malnutrition.'
