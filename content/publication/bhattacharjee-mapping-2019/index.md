abstract: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF)—giving infants only breast-milk (and medications,
  oral rehydration salts and vitamins as needed) with no additional food or drink
  for their first six months of life—is one of the most effective strategies for preventing
  child mortality1–4. Despite these advantages, only 37% of infants under 6 months
  of age in Africa were exclusively breastfed in 20175, and the practice of EBF varies
  by population. Here, we present a fine-scale geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence
  and trends in 49 African countries from 2000–2017, providing policy-relevant administrative-
  and national-level estimates. Previous national-level analyses found that most countries
  will not meet the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target of 50% EBF
  prevalence by 20256. Our analyses show that even fewer will achieve this ambition
  in all subnational areas. Our estimates provide the ability to visualize subnational
  EBF variability and identify populations in need of additional breastfeeding support.
