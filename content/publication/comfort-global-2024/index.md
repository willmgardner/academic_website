abstract: 'Stillbirth is a devastating and often avoidable adverse pregnancy outcome. Monitoring stillbirth levels and trends—in a comprehensive manner that leaves no one uncounted—is imperative for continuing progress in pregnancy loss reduction. This analysis, completed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, methodically accounted for different stillbirth definitions with the aim of comprehensively estimating all stillbirths at 20 weeks or longer for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021.
<br /> <br />
We extracted data on stillbirths from 11 412 sources across 185 of 204 countries and territories, including 234 surveys, 231 published studies, 1633 vital statistics reports, and 10 585 unique location-year combinations from vital registration systems. Our final dataset comprised 11 different definitions, which were adjusted to match two gestational age thresholds: 20 weeks or longer (reference) and 28 weeks or longer (for comparisons). We modelled the ratio of stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate with spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression for each location and year, and then used final GBD 2021 assessments of fertility and all-cause neonatal mortality to calculate total stillbirths. Secondary analyses evaluated the number of stillbirths missed with the more restrictive gestational age definition, trends in stillbirths as a function of Socio-demographic Index, and progress in reducing stillbirths relative to neonatal deaths.
<br /> <br />
In 2021, the global stillbirth rate was 23·0 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 19·7–27·2) per 1000 births (stillbirths plus livebirths) at 20 weeks' gestation or longer, compared to 16·1 (13·9–19·0) per 1000 births at 28 weeks' gestation or longer. The global neonatal mortality rate in 2021 was 17·1 (14·8–19·9) per 1000 livebirths, corresponding to 2·19 million (1·90–2·55) neonatal deaths. The estimated number of stillbirths occurring at 20 weeks' gestation or longer decreased from 5·08 million (95% UI 4·07–6·35) in 1990 to 3·04 million (2·61–3·62) in 2021, corresponding to a 39·8% (31·8–48·0) reduction, which lagged behind a global improvement in neonatal deaths of 45·6% (36·3–53·1) for the same period (down from 4·03 million [3·86–4·22] neonatal deaths in 1990). Stillbirths in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa comprised 77·4% (2·35 million of 3·04 million) of the global total, an increase from 60·3% (3·07 million of 5·08 million) in 1990. In 2021, 0·926 million (0·792–1·10) stillbirths, corresponding to 30·5% of the global total (3·04 million), occurred between 20 weeks' gestation and 28 weeks' gestation, with substantial variation at the country level.'
